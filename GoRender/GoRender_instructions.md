# GoRender Instructions

My sprites are created in Magicavoxel and rendered with GoRender.

To build:

1. Download GoRender from https://github.com/mattkimber/gorender
2. Install GoRender in a suitable location
3. Update file paths in the .bat rendering script for each vehicle. (GoRender doesn't seem to like the usual `'../'` file path notation to go up).
4. Enjoy!
